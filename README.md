## About Snowfox
Snowfox is a C++ project aimed at creating a cohesive and robust control system for the MATE ROV competition. It is a spiritual successor to our previous python library Seamoth that had a similar goal. The project is built by the Mamaroneck High School Robotics Team and named for snowy hoverbike bike in the video game Subnautica Below Zero by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. The application features [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) integration in order to make small changes for year to year, such as a new servo or thruster scheme, easier and faster to develop, RPi motor and servo controllability through gpio ports, RPi camera reading, and built in communication protocols designed specifically to integrate with [Leviathan](https://github.com/mamorobotics/Leviathan).

Snowfox is the compliment to our other C++ project, [Leviathan](https://github.com/mamorobotics/Leviathan), and is designed to run on the ROV as a standalone compiled binary. Future updates will likely include
