## About Snowfox
Snowfox is a c++ project aimed at creating a cohesive and robust control system for the MATE ROV competition. It is a spiritual successor to our previous python library Seamoth that had a similar goal. The project is built by the Mamaroneck High School Robotics Team and named for snowy hoverbike bike in the video game Subnautica Below Zero by Unknown Worlds Entertainment.
